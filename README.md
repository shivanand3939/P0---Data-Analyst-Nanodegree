An investigation for determining the optimum length of chopsticks.

Chopsticks!
A few researchers set out to determine the optimal length of chopsticks for children and adults. They came up with a measure of 
how effective a pair of chopsticks performed, called the "Food Pinching Performance." The "Food Pinching Performance" was 
determined by counting the number of peanuts picked and placed in a cup (PPPC).

Answered the following questions based only on the part of the experiment analyzing the thirty-one adult male college students

1. What is the independent variable in the experiment?
2. What is the dependent variable in the experiment?
3. How is the dependent variable operationally defined?
4. Based on the description of the experiment and the data set, list at least two variables that you know were controlled.
5. Which chopstick length performed the best for the group of thirty-one male junior college students?
6. Based on the scatterplot created from the code above, interpret the relationship you see. What do you notice?
7a. Based on the data you have analyzed, do you agree with the claim?
7b. If so, Why?
